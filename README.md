# leddartechone
Ros Drivers for the LeddartechOne This is a driver for the LeddarOne by Leddatech with a RS232 connection port for ROS. The package is written by lasdasdas and licensed under MIT. It has been tested for ROS kinetik and Indigo. 

You will need the std_msgs and the sensor_msgs packages and the modbus as well. You can install the modbus lib with:

sudo apt install libmodbus5

sudo apt install libmodbus-dev

After installing you just have to roslaunch it with:

roslaunch leddarone leddarone.launch

Some parameters can be set up in the launchfile:
baudrate for the baudrate
slaveid for the slaveid
port the port of the sensor.

This has to be set up like:
roslaunch leddarone leddarone.launch port:=9600


Other parameters like oversampling are hardcoded, they are already optimized and not really useful to change for a basic use. There is a brief comment on the source code and you will have to check the documentation to change it correctly.
